**Object Detection in Day and Low Light Conditions using Edge Devices for Vehicle Safety**

This project aims to implement object detection using YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 models for enhancing vehicle safety in both day and low light conditions. The project focuses on deploying these models on edge devices to ensure real-time detection capabilities without relying on cloud-based services, making it suitable for embedded systems in vehicles.

***Overview***
With the increasing need for vehicle safety systems, real-time object detection plays a crucial role in identifying potential hazards on the road. This project leverages state-of-the-art YOLO (You Only Look Once) models to detect various objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and obstacles under different lighting conditions.

***Features***
Detection of objects in both day and low light conditions.
Support for multiple YOLO model versions (v5, v6, v7, v8) for comparative analysis.
Real-time detection on edge devices for immediate response.
Integration with vehicle safety systems for collision avoidance and driver assistance.
Customizable for specific use cases and environments.
Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
sql
Copy code

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Object-detection-in-day-and-low-light-condition-using-Edge-device-for-vehicle-safety.git

***Install the required dependencies:***

cd Object-detection-in-day-and-low-light-condition-using-Edge-device-for-vehicle-safety

pip install -r requirements.txt

Download the pre-trained weights for the desired YOLO model version (v5, v6, v7, or v8) from the official sources or use custom weights if available.

Configure the model settings and input parameters according to your requirements.

***Usage***
Modify the configuration files to adjust detection thresholds, input resolution, and other parameters.
Experiment with different YOLO model versions to find the optimal performance for your application.
Integrate the object detection system with vehicle safety frameworks for real-world deployment.
