Object Detection in Day and Low-Light Conditions Using Edge Device for Vehicle Safety

Introduction
This project aims to provide a solution for vehicle safety by implementing object detection in both day and low-light conditions using a Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi No IR Camera. The system is designed to detect objects in real-time and estimate their distance from the camera, enhancing the driver's awareness of their surroundings, particularly in low-light situations.

Features
Object detection in both day and low-light conditions.
Real-time detection and distance estimation.
Utilizes Raspberry Pi for edge computing.
Integration with Raspberry Pi No IR Camera for night vision.
Requirements
Raspberry Pi board (preferably Raspberry Pi 3 or newer)
Raspberry Pi No IR Camera
Python 3.x
OpenCV library
TensorFlow or other suitable deep learning framework
Necessary dependencies as mentioned in the project's setup instructions
